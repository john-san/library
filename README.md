# TOP JavaScript Project #1: Library
This project's objective was to create a library. 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The user can manage a library by adding and removing books. They can also update the 'read' status of the book by clicking the icon next to 'read'.

I practiced working with a 'Book' object. I learned how to add functions to a prototype and reinforced my knowledge of using 'this' with an object. In addition, I practiced using bootstrap's modal and learned how to grab an image from the file input.
